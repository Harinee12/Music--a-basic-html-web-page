     <p>First up, weâ€™ll take a short vocal history: what singing experience do you have? Have you had lessons in the past, and if so, what did you learn? What did you like and dislike about those lessons? Do you play any instruments? Most importantly, do you have any health issues or vocal health concerns? Although it doesnâ€™t happen often, I will recommend you first get checked out by a laryngologist if you have symptoms that indicate vocal injury. I am not a doctor or a speech therapist, and if thatâ€™s the care you need at this time, that comes first!

        Lastly, I want to know if you have any specific concerns or goals. And while itâ€™s okay to have the general goal of overall improvement, itâ€™s really helpful to share what your specific goals are. That could be: strengthening your voice, eliminating strain when you sing higher, auditioning for a school musical, learning to harmonize. I want your lessons, even if we only have one lesson together, to support your goals for yourself.</p>
     <p>MY number one goal as a teacher is your vocal health and longevity. I want to equip you to sing the songs you love, and to continue your vocal development on your own! Most of us cannot afford consistent lessons with a private teacher, so itâ€™s very important to me that you understand what weâ€™re working on and know how to apply what you learn in your individual practice.

        Next up, weâ€™ll do a short assessment. At this point, I assure you that itâ€™s normal to crack at some point! Cracking is not a failure. Where and why you crack gives me valuable information to help you, so please donâ€™t apologize if your voice does something funny. Please sing along as youâ€™re able!</p>
